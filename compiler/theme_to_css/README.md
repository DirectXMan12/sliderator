# theme-to-css

This tool converts Sublime JSON themes to CSS rules suitable for using with the
syntax highlighting generated by the main slides compiler.

See, for instance, [the solarized theme](/third_party/solarized-dark) included
in this repository.

It takes the theme JSON on stdin, and writes it to stdout.
