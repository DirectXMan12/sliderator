# Sample Template

This is a sample template to generate your slides with. Specifically,
`template.html` will have your slide HTML substituted in.  The associated
CSS & JS files should be copied verbatim to a `sample-template`
subdirectory of your output directory.

You'll need to use the theme-to-css tool in this repo to generate
a `highlighting.css` file for syntax highlighting.
